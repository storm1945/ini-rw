# ini-rw
Fork from  [ini-file-parser](https://github.com/DevelopersToolbox/ini-file-parser/)\
Very simply tools to read/write/create key-value pair bash script. ENJOY !!!\
Useage:
+ TO READ: sh ini-rw.sh [filepath] [section] [key]
+ TO SET : sh ini-rw.sh [filepath] [section] [key] [value]
  If key-value pair do not exist, the script will append it to the last line of the section.
